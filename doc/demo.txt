少年不识愁滋味，爱上层楼
爱上层楼，为赋新词强说愁
而今识尽愁滋味，欲说还休
欲说还休，却道天凉好个秋

While young, I knew no grief I could not bear;
I’d like to go upstair.
I’d like to go upstair
To write new verses with a false despair.

I know what grief is now that I am old;
I would not have it told.
I would not have it told,
But only say I’m glad that autumn’s cold.

露の世は露の世ながらさりながら
